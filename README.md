# TheaterProject
#The first iteration of the Theater Project for Object Oriented Design and Implementation (ICS 372).
This project was developed by David, Franklin, and Vanessa using UML software design.

The project focuses on creating a theater system for a theater that holds one auditorium and shows one play/showing a day.The software is intended to be ran from the command line iterface via a clerk who is in charge of entering and customer & clientele info.

Iteration 2 of this project will be extending the functionality of this iteration and providing a more robust and efficient design while limiting the use of multiple list classes.
